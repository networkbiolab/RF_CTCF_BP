# RF_CTCF_BP
Random Forest CTCF Binding Predictor


This projact contaisn the code required to replicate the Manuscritp by Villaman et al. "Prediction of CTCF binding and the role of histone marks on the spatial organization of chromatin"


alberto.martin@uss.cl

code and data is organized in folders as follows:

  - shortex.zip: folder with data files required to generate input files for chromosome 4
  - CTCF.fimo.sortedBed: bed file with FIMO determined CTCF binding sites
  - matrixmaker.py: python3 script that takes as input files in the shortex folder and CTCF.fimo.sortedBed to generate input files for the RF predictor
